# How to mess with Runcommand  
_by @RickDangerous_

Each time you load a Game there is an option to open what is called
the Runcommand Launch Menu.

## The Runcommand Launch Menu

1. This is accessed by pressing any button on a controller or kebyoard.
I usually use A or X depending on my controller.

Below is the launch screen for Arcade.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  
  ![Arcade Launch Screen](../../../../assets/guides/emulationstation/runcommand_1.png "Arcade Launch Screen")
</div>

2. After pressing a button / key whilst loading a game you will be shown
a menu like below depending on the system you choose.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  
  ![System Menu](../../../../assets/guides/emulationstation/runcommand_2.png "System Menu")
</div>

3. You are given several menu options of which four will be covered now:

- Select default emulator for arcade (lr-fbneo)  
Which ever emulator we choose with this option will be the main default emulator for the whole system.

- Select emulator for ROM  
We can choose which emulator we want for the current game we are loading. The change will get saved to the emulators.cfg.

- Select video mode for lr-fbneo  
This will allow you to set a custom resolution for the emulator.  
This change will get saved in videomodes.cfg

- Select video mode for lr-fbneo ROM  
This will allow you to set a custom resolution for the current game we are loading. This change will get saved in videomodes.cfg

## Disable the Launch Menu

The run command configuration is useful to disable the launch menu. You might wanâ€™t to do this to stop accidentally changing an emulator or video setting which might stop a game from launching. This is very useful if you have kids.

1. Navigate to the options screen.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  
  ![System Menu](../../../../assets/guides/emulationstation/runcommand_3.png "System Menu")
</div>

2. Choose Run Command Configuration

<div style="text-align: center;">
  
  ![System Menu](../../../../assets/guides/emulationstation/runcommand_4.png "System Menu")
</div>

3. Change Launch Menu to Current Disabled

<div style="text-align: center;">
  
  ![System Menu](../../../../assets/guides/emulationstation/runcommand_5.png "System Menu")
</div>
