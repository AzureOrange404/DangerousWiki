# Gemini Capsule

This wiki is also available via the new internet protocol [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/), which is a private and secure alternative to the https standard of today. 

Gemini only features a text based environment, therefore videos, pictures etc. which are included into a gemini capsule (what's their term for website) will directly be opened with the software of your choice.
