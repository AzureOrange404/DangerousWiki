_by @RickDangerous_

1. Goto Options  

<div style="text-align: center;">
  
  ![Arcade Launch Screen](../../../../assets/guides/controller/options.png "Arcade Launch Screen")
</div>

2. Retropie Setup
3. Configuration / tools
4. Emulationstation
5. Swap A/B Buttons in ES (Currently Swapped)

Once you have done the above your need to configure your input again for any controller you wish to be swapped in EmulationStation.
