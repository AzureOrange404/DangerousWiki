# Welcome

  Welcome to the official Rick Dangerous Project Wiki.   
  This wiki mainly functions as a guide for using the Never Ending Edition RetroPie image by Rick Dangerous.

## The Rick Dangerous Project

  Rick Dangerous loved playing games on various systems since he was a little kid. When he got into emulation he became obsessed and eventually released his disk images to be downloaded.
  
  The **Never Ending Edition** (NEE) is the newest creation by Rick Dangerous and it probably will be the last edition produced within this project.
  
  It is not completed yet and there will be a final release when it is. More about Rick Dangerous and his project in the [about](/docs/about.md) section.


## Hardware

The hardware section will be used to primarely share recommendations of hardware to be used with RetroPie and especially the NEE.
