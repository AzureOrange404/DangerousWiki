# The Rick Dangerous Project

  This site mainly functions as a guide for using RetroPie especially with a Rick Dangerous disk image.
  
  The newest Disk Image of the Rick Dangerous Project is called the Never Ending Edition (NEE), which probably will be the latest Edition produced inside this Project.
  
  The NEE will recieve monthly updates until it reaches a size of roughly 1 TB.
  
  *The wiki is still in early development*
