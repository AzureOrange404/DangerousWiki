# Welcome

  Welcome to the official Rick Dangerous Project Wiki.   
  This wiki mainly functions as a guide for using the Never Ending Edition RetroPie image by Rick Dangerous.

# The Rick Dangerous Project

  Rick Dangerous loved playing games on various systems since he was a little kid. When he got into emulation he became obsessed and even released his disk images to be downloaded.   
  The **Never Ending Edition** (NEE) is the newest creation by Rick Dangerous and it probably will be the last edition produced within this project.
  But it is not completed yet and will recieve monthly updates until it reaches a size of roughly 1 TB.   
  More about Rick Dangerous and his project in the [about](/docs/about.md) section.
