# Welcome

  Welcome to the official Rick Dangerous Project Wiki.   
  This wiki mainly functions as a guide for using the Never Ending Edition RetroPie image by Rick Dangerous.

## The Rick Dangerous Project

  Rick Dangerous loved playing games on various systems since he was a little kid. When he got into emulation he became obsessed and even released his disk images to be downloaded.   
  
  The **Never Ending Edition** (NEE) is the newest creation by Rick Dangerous and it probably will be the last edition produced within this project.
  
  It is not completed yet and will recieve some updates. The Never Ending But Ended Edition will then again be available to download.
  
  More about Rick Dangerous and his project in the [about](/docs/about.md) section.

## Alternative DNS

This wiki is also available via the new internet protocol [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/), which is a private and secure alternative to the https standard of today. 

Gemini only features a text based environment, therefore videos, pictures etc. which are included to a gemini capsule (what's their word for webpage) will directly be opened with the software of your choice.

A recommended browser for you linux termal would be [amfora](https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora), which also works directly on your Raspberry Pi.
