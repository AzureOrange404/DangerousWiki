# The RickDangerous Project

  This site mainly functions as a guide for using RetroPie especially with a RickDangerous disk image.
  
  The newest Disk Image of the RickDangerous Project ist called the Never Ending Edition (NEE), which probably will be the latest Edition produced inside this Project.
  
  The NEE will recieve monthly updates until it reaches a size of roughly 1 TB.
